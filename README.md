# 1Left

**Set a limit. See what's left.**

Minimalist budget tracking app for Android. No accounts, no sync, no ads - just you and your spending limit.

**Website:** [1left.app](https://1left.app)

## Problem

Every budget app wants to be your financial advisor. They demand sign-ups, sync your data, track categories, generate reports. All I needed during my student years was simple: I have €100 for a certain period, show me what's left.

## Solution

One screen. One number. No friction.

    A[Set limit] --> B[Spend]
    B --> C[See what's left]
    C --> B
```

## How it works

1. Set your spending limit (weekly, monthly, or any amount)
2. Log expenses as you spend
3. See what's left at a glance

That's it.
